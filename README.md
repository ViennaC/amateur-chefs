## Description
This project was created with a partner.
Amateur Chefs is a community-based recipe website where members are welcome to upload their own homemade recipes or blogs sharing fun and exciting new cooking ideas or experiences.

#### Personal Contribution
I constructed HTML forms with front-end validation using JavaScript in order to upload recipes and blogs as well as developed the server side using PHP and MySQL. I also designed an account information page that retrieved and displayed information from MySQL. We collaborated on the layout and appearance of the website.
